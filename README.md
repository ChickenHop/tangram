<h1>Unity Developer Test</h1>
Credit: This test was originally created by Joe Shochet, co-founder and CTO of codeSpark. Thanks, Joe!
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h4>1. Implement a basic tangram game in Unity, starting from our project template.</h4>
<h4>2. Clone or fork this Unity project on github.</h4>
<h4>3. Implement the Piece.cs class to add things like:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Moving pieces</li>
<li>Rotating pieces</li>
<li>Puzzle completion detection</li>
<li>Sounds and other effects for polish</li>
<li>Other fun ideas!</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Feel free to add more classes, models, small plugins, and modify any of the prefabs and setup given.</h4>
<h4>5. Time expectation is around 2-3 hours.</h4>
It is not expected that you will build a fully completed game, so it is up to you how you spend your time. Our
audience is aged 4-10; create a gameplay experience that will be easy for young kids.
<h1>Requirements</h1>
<h4>This project template was built in Unity 6000.0.38f1. Any Unity 6 LTS should work!</h4>
<h4>Target Desktop, WebGL, Android, or iOS.</h4>

<h1>Rubric</h1>
Your submission will be evaluated on code quality, readability, sophistication, and gameplay feel.
When completed, email adam.saslow@beginlearning.com with the following:
<h4>1. Zip of your Unity project (or link to a github fork, cloud file, etc). No need to create a build, but if you
want to, you can include or link that too.</h4>
<h4>2. Any implementation notes, planning docs, assumptions, or design thoughts youâ€™d like to include.</h4>
<h4>3. Estimate of time spent (expectation is around 2-3 hours).</h4>
